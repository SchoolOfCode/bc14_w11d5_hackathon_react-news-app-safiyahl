# News App Hackathon

Welcome to the News App Hackathon! 🎉 In this exercise, you will be creating a news app using the [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) to display the latest news stories in a card format. This exercise will allow you to practice your React skills while having fun building a real-world application. Let's get started! 💪

## Task 1: Exploring the API

Sign up and explore the API. Familiarize yourself with the [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) documentation and sample data to understand the structure of the responses.

To explore and use the API, follow these steps:
1. Visit the [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) website.
2. Sign up for a free account.
3. Explore the available documentation and sample data to understand how to fetch news articles. What endpoints and query parameters can you use to find articles? What structure does the data have?

It's a good idea to test your requests by writing a simple fetch request in your browser and console logging the data it returns, but **keep in mind the limitations of the free version**. Since it allows only 100 requests, think about how to handle this effectively once you understand the data you can retrieve. One approach could be using mock data for testing and development purposes until you are ready to make actual requests. This way, you can save your API requests for the final implementation. 🧪

## Task 2: Initialization and Planning

Set up your development environment and install the necessary dependencies. Initialize your React App and clean up the files to start fresh. 💪🏽

When planning your project, consider the following:
1. File & Component Structure: Think about how you will structure your project's files and components. Create a component tree in your software of choice and really think about what data needs to be accessed by each component. Where do your state variables need to live? How are you going to pass information between components? 
2. Passing Information to Cards: Each news story will be displayed in a card format. Brainstorm how you will pass information from the fetched data into these cards. Use React's props to pass data between components efficiently. Make sure to understand core concepts like useState and props as they are essential for this exercise.

## Task 3: MVP

Implement the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Start building your News App by fetching and displaying news stories using React. Practice with just one endpoint first, and once that is implemented, you can explore other options.

Congratulations on implementing the MVP! 🎉 Your News App can now fetch and display news stories.

## Bonus Tasks

If you want to challenge yourself further, here are some optional bonus tasks:

1. Add Pagination: Implement functionality to load more news stories as the user scrolls or clicks on a "Load More" button.
2. Implement Search: Allow users to search for specific news stories using the API's search endpoint.
3. Add Category Filters: Enable users to filter news stories by categories, such as sports, technology, or entertainment.
4. Improve Styling: Enhance the visual appeal of your app by refining the CSS styles.

Remember, these bonus tasks are optional and can be completed after achieving the MVP. Feel free to get creative and make your News App shine! ✨

We hope you enjoy this hackathon and have fun building your News App! If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to coaches or your fellow bootcampers. Happy coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻
